## 📝 Course Review

The *Security Operations Fundamentals* course by Palo Alto is concise yet insightful, providing an overview of modern SOC workflows, alert pipelines, and operational KPIs. While not tool-deep, it’s platform-agnostic and ideal for learners building situational awareness.

### ✅ What I Liked

- Structured content with practical case mappings  
- Emphasis on alert quality over volume  
- Encouragement of playbook-based SOC design

### 📌 What Could Be Improved

- Add interactive SIEM/EDR hands-on labs  
- Expand on threat intel and automation scripting (e.g., Python SOAR)

---

## 📎 Ideal For

- Cybersecurity Students  
- SOC Tier 1–2 Analysts  
- Red/Blue Teamers seeking better understanding of detection ops
