# 🛡️ Introduction to Security Operations Centers (SOC)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. It is responsible for monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cyber threats around the clock.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives of a SOC

- 🔍 **Continuous Monitoring** – 24/7 oversight of logs, alerts, and network traffic.
- 🧠 **Threat Detection** – Identifying suspicious behaviors, anomalies, and attacks.
- 🚨 **Incident Response** – Taking swift actions to contain, mitigate, and resolve incidents.
- 📈 **Security Improvement** – Analyzing trends and enhancing the overall security posture.

## 🧩 SOC Components

| Component           | Role                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **SIEM**            | Aggregates and correlates logs/events from all sources |
| **Analyst Tiers**   | Structured into Tier 1, 2, 3 with increasing expertise |
| **Threat Intel**    | Feeds known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) into analysis |
| **Playbooks & SOPs**| Standardized incident handling guides                 |
| **Ticketing System**| Manages alert lifecycle, documentation & audit trail |

## 🧑‍💼 SOC Roles (Tiered Model)

| Tier | Role                      | Responsibilities                                 |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Alert Triage              | Monitor SIEM alerts, basic filtering             |
| 2    | Incident Responder        | Deep dive investigation, root cause analysis     |
| 3    | Threat Hunter/Engineer    | Proactive threat hunting, tool tuning, automation|

## 🛠️ SOC Tools & Tech Stack

- 🖥️ SIEM: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ELK Stack, Cortex XSIAM
- 🧪 Sandbox: Palo Alto WildFire, Cuckoo
- 📬 Email Security: Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender
- 🧠 Threat Intel: VirusTotal, Anomali, MISP
- 🔐 EDR: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, XDR platforms

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Define clear **Use Cases** (e.g., Brute-force login attempts, data exfiltration)
- Regular **Playbook Testing** (Tabletop or Purple Team exercises)
- **Metrics** tracking: MTTR (Mean Time To Respond), False Positive Rate
- Foster a culture of **continuous improvement & learning**

## 🧾 Summary

SOC is the **nerve center** of an organization’s cybersecurity program. By combining people, process, and technology, it enables **rapid response** to threats and supports strategic defense goals.
